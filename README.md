# Class Scheduler Application

**Problem:** There is a strong demand from immigrants for naturalization classes
in NYC. There is also a large supply of volunteers offering to teach such
classes. The bottleneck is that connecting immigrants and volunteers is done
manually by non-profit staff, who do not have the capacity to provide
matching/scheduling services.

**Purpose:** Build a Rails app that lets clients schedule naturalization classes with
volunteers.

## Minimum Viable Product

- Multilingual pages

- Authentication
	- Client / Volunteer Sign-up && Login

- Scheduling
	- Volunteers can create class sessions
	- Clients can search for class sessions by location, date, and language
	- Clients and volunteers can communicate

- Credibility/Safety
	- Non-anonymous volunteer accounts
	- Clients and volunteers can review each other
	- Legal Disclaimer

- Mobile first design

- Cost
	- Free to use
	- Free/Cheap to maintain

- Admin view
	- view Client-Tutor connections
	- view / delete accounts

## Views

Meta:
- `/`

User Authentication:
- `sign_up/client`
- `sign_up/volunteer`
- `sign_in`

Scheduling:
- `search`: index page for clients to search for class sessions
- `availabilities/new`: show/edit page for volunteers to create/edit schedules

## Models

- `User`
- `Role`
- `Availability`
- `Program`

## Libraries

- `moment`
- `react-joi-validation`
- `joi-browser`
- `material-ui`

## Get started

- `$ bundle install`
- `$ yarn install`
- `$ rake db:create RAILS_ENV=development`
- `$ rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development`
- `$ rake db:seed`
- `$ rake assets:precompile`
- `$ foreman start`

## Troubleshooting

When deploying to Amazon, if node garbage collection leaks and you get a V8:
- restart the app
- deploy latest stable version
- try again

## SSL certificates

are provided by Let's Encrypt via the use of certbot on the server

## IMPORTANT

Do not deploy master to staging
Staging does not have the certificates set up by bash scripts on master
The app will crash

Node modules are version controlled for the sake of Amazon EC2
